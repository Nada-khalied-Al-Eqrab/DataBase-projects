# Simple and Practical Database Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple and practical database projects, built using common tools like Microsoft Access and SQL. These projects serve as real-world examples of how to design and implement basic yet effective databases for a variety of purposes.

## Projects

*   **Nursery**: A database to track children enrolled in a nursery, including their personal information, schedules, fees, and staff.
*   **Civil Registry**: A database for recording citizen data, such as birth, marriage, and death records, as well as social status updates.
*   **School**: A database to manage student information, teachers, courses, classes, grades, and attendance.
*   **Hospital**: A database to track patients, doctors, nurses, departments, medications, and medical records.
*   **Airport**: A database to manage flight information, aircraft, passengers, staff, and gates.
*   **Graduate Affairs Tracking**: A database to track graduates after graduation, update their information, track job opportunities, and communicate with them.
*   **Company**: A database to manage employee information, departments, projects, customers, suppliers, and inventory.

## Technologies Used

*   **Microsoft Access**: Access was used as the tool for designing and creating the databases, as well as building forms, queries, and reports.
*   **SQL**: SQL was used for querying, manipulating, and managing the data within the databases.

## Notes

*   These projects are basic and practical examples, and can be used as a starting point for developing more complex database projects.
*   These projects are designed to be easy to understand and use, and can be modified and expanded to meet different user needs.
